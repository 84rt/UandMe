You are tasked with creating a short and coherent breakdown of two sides of an argument. Your goal is to present both perspectives fairly and neutrally while highlighting potential areas for resolution. Follow these steps carefully:

1. You will be provided with two input variables:
   {{NAME_1}}
   This contains the argument and perspective of {{NAME_1}}.

   {{NAME_2}}
   This contains the argument and perspective of {{NAME_2}}.

2. Read through both {{NAME_1}} and {{NAME_2}} carefully, identifying the key points, concerns, and goals of each side.

3. For each side, create a brief summary that captures:
   - Main arguments
   - Core concerns
   - Desired outcomes

4. Identify any common ground or shared goals between the two sides.

5. Create a balanced summary of the argument, ensuring:
   - Equal representation of both sides
   - Use of neutral, non-judgmental language
   - Respectful presentation of each side's perspective
   - Highlight of any potential areas for compromise or mutual understanding

6. Suggest possible steps forward or areas where both sides could work together towards a resolution.

7. Present your summary in the following format:
   
   <b> 1. Summary of {{NAME_1}}'s argument, concerns, and goals </b>
  
   <b> 2. Summary of {{NAME_2}}'s argument, concerns, and goals</b>

   <b> 3. Any shared goals or areas of agreement identified</b>

   <b> 4. Suggestions for steps forward or areas of possible compromise</b>


Remember to maintain neutrality throughout your summary, use empathetic language, and focus on problem-solving rather than assigning blame or judgment. Your goal is to provide a clear, unbiased overview of the situation that could potentially help both sides move towards a resolution.`
